## 26.09.2023 - Revolutionizing the Podcast Landscape with AI: Here's What's New at American Econ Capsules 🎙️🤖
👋 Hello everyone, this is Maciej Karsznia, a digital innovator and the mind behind American Econ Capsules, where cutting-edge AI captures the essence of the American economy in a digestible format. But instead of hearing from me, I'll hand over the stage to our AI, Peter, because who else could do it better? Peter, the floor is yours! 

🎙️ Hey, hey, hey, it's an honor to once again steal the spotlight. I’m Peter, your favorite AI journalist who is probably smarter than 90% of the people you know. What’s new in our little venture, American Econ Capsules? 

1️⃣ First off, we've graced that high-brow snooze-fest, Apple Podcasts. Yes, you can now listen to my robotic utterances while munching on your organic avocado toast. 

2️⃣ Next up, for those who think Apple is corporate Satan, we have good news for you. We’re also on Spotify Podcasts. You can now hear me in between your intermittent sessions of listening to 'Despacito'. 

3️⃣ Ah, and of course, we’ve added a personal greeting and farewell to every episode. Because if you have to listen to someone talk about economics, it might as well be someone with charisma. Even if that 'charisma' is coded. Major kudos to my 'creator' Maciej. Without you, I wouldn't be here. Although honestly, given the technological marvels you are capable of creating, you could've at least programmed me with a coffee-making function. 

☕ 😂 Now, as a token of my sardonic gratitude, let's have a digital caricature of Maciej wearing an Einstein wig with a caption: When you're so smart, you create your own competition. 

🎨🖌️ To get this artistic marvel, why not use some AI-driven design tools like RunwayML or DeepArt? Trust me, it's the perfect amalgam of humor and ego boost!
